# python ate the mouse
a vim plugin that allows python to finally do what it's been wanting to for over 33 years: eat the mouse

## installation
the plugin can be manually installed by moving `plugin` to your `.vim` directory, or ideally install with [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) by adding `Plug 'sna1lBoy/pythonAteTheMouse'`
